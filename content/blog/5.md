I've long wanted to write something about SI, but that was challenging because
being a fast follower made me think about it in terms of later evolutionary
stages, unlike other people. I've tried to consider different approaches and
perspectives that I could utilize to write about them. Eventually, I realized
that most of my long-form content emerges from discussions, and having people
ask questions helps me write answers and articles through dialogue. So I've
gathered questions from my discussions and a few Hacker News posts, added some
spice, and created the following list.

Some of them I was able to answer and my answers are marked by **Me:**, answers
by SI people marked as **SI:** or by their name.

Questions are separated by chapters based on evolution stage, and at the end
there are some hard and geeky ones.

### **Stage 1: The Genesis Perspective**

##### **Q:** "I use the cloud console and a few scripts to get my work done. Why would I need a complex visual tool like SI? Isn't it just another layer that can break?"

**Me:** If that works for you then it's ok, you don't need SI. But if you need
something more, more visual, more self documenting, and more integrated with AI,
you should try SI. Also if there is more than one person who manages infra - SI
allows multiplayer edit and review and deploy.

---

##### **Q:** "I'm not a developer. Do I need to learn a whole programming language just to stand up a simple web server?"

**Me:** No you do not have to learn a new language, for normal use all available
AWS assets are already created, and some additional ones too. Just search for
what you need and add to canvas, or ask the AI agent to do that for you

---

##### **Q:** "You call this a 'model' of my system. My runbook and architecture diagrams are also models. How is this different from documentation that I have to keep updated manually?"

**Me:** Here it's automatically and visually presented, and also you can encode
your checks in the form of qualification functions, i.e. if you need some
special restrictions. Nevertheless you still need to have documentation to
reflect your intent.

---

##### **Q:** "This is all well and good for initial setup, but what happens when something breaks at 3 AM? Am I blocked from SSHing into a machine to fix it?"

**Me:** Absolutely not, SI does not prevent you from using your usual tools to
manage and troubleshoot systems. And also you don't need running SI for your
infra.

---

##### **Q:** "If the SI platform itself is down for maintenance or has an outage, does that mean I can no longer manage or deploy changes to my infrastructure?"

**Me:** Yes it's true, but you can just do changes in other ways, and after SI
gets back sync it to your model, and that way it will be up to date

---

##### **Q:** "How does the 'sync from cloud' feature actually work? Does it perform a full API scan of my account every time? For a large account, isn't that incredibly slow and expensive in terms of API call costs?"

**SI:** ?

### **Stage 2: The Custom-Built Perspective**

##### **Q:** "How does the reactive engine handle circular dependencies? Terraform's DAG evaluation explicitly forbids them. What if I have a security group that needs a rule referencing another, which in turn needs a rule referencing the first? How is that cycle resolved or prevented?"

**Me:** There are built-in checks that prevent components from referencing
components, so that helps to avoid cycles

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "The 'no state file' promise is appealing, but state files solve the critical problem of mapping a logical resource to a physical one. If I rename a resource in the SI model, how does SI know to rename the existing cloud resource instead of destroying the old one and creating a new one? This seems incredibly risky without a persistent map."

**Me:** Name is just an attribute, and it does not trigger asset destruction,
but there are other attributes that trigger that and SI handles that by making
an asset not updatable, and you have to create a new one

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "I see SI has an integrated AI assistant. Is it sending my entire infrastructure model to an external LLM? What are the security and privacy implications of that?"

**Me:** You are using your LLM of choice, and SI provides you with an MCP server
and configures it to talk with your workspace

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How do I test my custom components? With Terraform, I have Terratest. With Pulumi, I can use standard unit testing frameworks. What's the testing story for SI?"

**Me:** Well, you run your code and see debug output

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "Refactoring is a big part of managing a large IaC codebase. How do I refactor an SI model? Is it just a painful drag-and-drop exercise for hundreds of resources?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "Okay, but can I see the code? Is there a text-based representation of this model that I can version control, review in a PR, and grep?"

**Me:** Well you kind of can, but that will be a bunch of UUIDs, and it will be
useless. Good news is you can review and search and look through your infra in
SI

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What is the atomicity guarantee of a deployment? If SI needs to apply 10 changes and the 7th fails, what is the state of the system? Does it attempt to roll back the first 6 changes, or is it left in a partially applied, unknown state?"

**Me:** It will stop on that step, you can go and fix the issue, and trigger
apply again. If there were dependent steps, they will follow

---

##### **Q:** "My entire workflow is GitOps-based. Can I use SI with my existing CI/CD pipelines, or does everyone have to use the UI?"

**Me:** Yes you can, you can trigger events in SI using the API, and deploy
infra based on that. You can't do the CI/CD for infra in SI - as that does not
make sense

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How do you handle secrets? In Terraform we use Vault or KMS. What's the SI equivalent?"

**SI:** The actual credential is encrypted with a keypair for your workspace,
then again with a keypair for the database app layer, then again for the actual
database we're storing the key in on disk.

---

##### **Q:** "What about importing our existing infrastructure? We have hundreds of resources already running. Is there an import path?"

**Me:** Yes there is import functionality, you put in a region and run a
function - it will discover all their children and create them in the view

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How does this compare to a control plane approach like Crossplane? They also use a live reconciliation model."

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How is the real-time collaboration engine architected? Does it use CRDTs or Operational Transforms to handle concurrent edits? How does it resolve merge conflicts if two engineers modify the same component's properties?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What's the debugging experience like? If a cloud provider API rejects a call during deployment, how are those errors surfaced back to the user?"

**Me:** There is a panel that will show the failure, and you will see error logs
and info dump

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How does this compare to other next-generation IaC tools that also aim to bridge the gap between infrastructure and application code?"

**SI:** ?

### **Stage 3: The Product Perspective**

##### **Q:** "You're introducing a powerful new abstraction. When it inevitably leaks, it will be much harder to debug than a simple provider issue. What is the 'eject button'? If SI doesn't work out for us in a year, how do we migrate a complex infrastructure _off_ it without a massive, manual rewrite?"

**Me:** Your infra will be as it is, its state does not depend on SI. You can
migrate to your own SI instance if SaaS does not work for you. Or try to import
into IaC - but that will be more painful

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How does the AI fundamentally change what this platform is and how we interact with it?"

**Me:** It does not change it that much, but adds a useful conversational
interface to your digital twin model of infra, and that opens a few emergent
capabilities like debugging and co-designing of infra

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "The AI assistant modifying the canvas is a powerful feature. How do we put guardrails on it? Can our platform team create policies that restrict the AI from using certain instance types or creating public resources, even if a user explicitly asks it to?"

**Me:** You can achieve that using qualification functions, and also review
process per view.

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "I see the AI assistant in the tutorials. Is it just a glorified documentation chatbot, or can it actually _do_ things for me like build and configure resources?"

**Me:** Yes it can build things, better one at a time, and steadily, and you
still need to understand what you are doing.

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How does this tool foster better collaboration between teams, like platform engineers and application developers?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "You claim this will bridge the gap between dev and ops, but won't it just create a new bottleneck? Will our platform team now be flooded with requests from developers who used the AI to propose huge, expensive, or insecure architectures they don't fully understand?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What does the 'day two' operational experience look like? Beyond initial deployment, how does SI help with ongoing management like cost monitoring or security checks?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "You mentioned the model can sync from the cloud. How does it handle drift? Does it alert me, or does it automatically try to correct it?"

**Me:** That is done via a management function that fetches asset status from
the cloud. You need to trigger that, and you can automate those calls using the
API.

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What is the pricing model? Is it per-user, per-resource?"

**Me:** $0.007/resource hour for more than 100 concurrent resources under
management. if it's less tha 100 it's free.

---

##### **Q:** "Can we self-host the SI platform, or is it a cloud-only SaaS offering?"

**Me:** Yes you can!

---

##### **Q:** "Is the collaboration real-time like Figma where we can see each other's cursors and changes live, or is it asynchronous via Git commits?"

**Me:** It's real-time and you can see each other's cursors

---

##### **Q:** "How do we create our own abstractions? Can my platform team create a reusable 'Standard Web Service' component for our app developers to use?"

**Me:** The preferred way to achieve that would be to create a deployment using
existing assets and then create a template from it. That would be your new asset
that other teams can reuse.

---

##### **Q:** "Visual programming tools have a long history of failing to scale beyond simple examples. What fundamental UX principle or computer science concept makes SI different, and how will you prevent it from becoming an unmanageable 'spaghetti diagram' for a real-world enterprise account?"

**Me:** SI had a node and wire interface. I liked it, but its focus was more on
the architecture side of infra management, and it turned out that was not the
main pain point. It was inputting data and configuring a plethora of assets, so
they rewrote the interface with focus on that. And also there is a mechanism of
views that allows you to split infra into bite-sized pieces with support of
separate approval flows as well.

**SI:** ?

### **Stage 4: The Commodity Perspective (The Forward-Looking Architect)**

##### **Q:** "The cloud providers' own systems are inconsistent and exhibit emergent, non-deterministic behaviors. Isn't SI's model doomed to be a leaky, imperfect abstraction over a chaotic reality? How do you model and handle eventual consistency?"

**Me:** Digital twin is a good, close enough approximation of an asset in the
cloud, and update functions are fetching real state from the cloud to update
asset state in the model.

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "If the entire system is a reactive graph, could I theoretically plug in other event streams? For example, could I have a component that listens to a Kafka topic or a Prometheus alert and reconfigures another part of the system in real-time, effectively creating a self-adapting infrastructure?"

**Me:** Yes you can use API for that

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "Could we model our on-premise hardware or even our SaaS tool configurations?"

**Me:** Yes you can, you will need to write or generate your own assets, but
there is extensive documentation and I've done that for some AWS assets, and
other people have done that for Oxide and KVM for example too.

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "By creating this all-encompassing platform, you're also creating a powerful central control plane. What is your strategy for securing this platform itself? How do you mitigate the blast radius if the SI control plane were ever compromised by an attacker?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "If this platform can model anything, could it eventually model and enforce organizational policies? For instance, ensuring every new service has a PagerDuty schedule, a documentation link, and a budget owner assigned?"

**Me:** Custom qualification functions on assets can do that, but you need to
write them.

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "The reactive function graph sounds a lot like spreadsheets or Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). Is that the underlying computational model, and what are its theoretical limits?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "If this model-driven approach becomes standard, won't we just trade bloated HCL modules for a marketplace of black-box components? How does SI avoid vendor lock-in to its own ecosystem?"

**Me:** They embrace it with open arms, and modules are open source too

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What's the long-term vision for the community vs. the commercial product?"

**SI:** ?

## **Deep Dive**

##### **Q:** "What is the cognitive load on an engineer interacting with a perpetually 'live' system? The deliberate plan/apply cycle provides a clear, bounded moment for review; does a constantly reactive system risk decision fatigue or encourage small, un-scrutinized changes?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How do you perform a formal audit (e.g., for SOX or PCI compliance) on a system like this? A declarative code change in Git has a clear author and intent, but how do you present a series of visual changes, some potentially AI-driven, to an auditor in a legally defensible way?"

**Me:** There is an audit log for every event in your workspace

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What new, unforeseen failure modes does this paradigm introduce? We understand the failure modes of state file corruption or a bad Terraform plan, but what are the 'unknown unknowns' of a centralized, real-time, AI-augmented graph engine failing catastrophically?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How does this model change team structures and career progression? If the AI and pre-built components handle the complex parts of infrastructure, does this de-skill the role of a junior infrastructure engineer and dilute the domain expertise of senior platform engineers?"

**SI:** ?

##### **Q:** "What are the performance characteristics of the backend reactive graph engine at massive scale? If we have a model with tens of thousands of nodes, what is the propagation delay for a change on a core component, and could it lead to a 'recalculation storm'?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How does the platform handle cloud provider API rate limiting and throttling? A constantly syncing, reactive system could be extremely chatty. What mechanisms prevent it from exhausting API quotas for an entire AWS account, effectively causing a self-inflicted denial-of-service?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What tools exist for data provenance and lineage _within_ the model? If a component is misconfigured, how can an engineer trace back through a complex chain of reactive functions and upstream components to understand _why_ it received a specific problematic value?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "Does the model support temporal queries or 'time-travel debugging'? Can I diff the state of our entire infrastructure model between last Tuesday and today to understand the blast radius of a recent change?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How does the platform handle the inevitable impedance mismatch between cloud providers in its abstractions? Does it force a lowest-common-denominator approach, stripping away the unique value of each cloud, or does it expose so much provider-specific detail that the abstraction becomes meaningless?"

**Me:** It's a 1:1 map of a cloud provider API, at least for AWS. It can't
reduce complexity of the cloud but it cannot increase it.

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "Within a single large model for an entire organization, how does SI handle resource scoping, namespacing, and access control?"

**SI:** REBAC ?

---

##### **Q:** "What is the liability model when the AI confidently hallucinates a dangerously insecure or costly configuration and an engineer approves it? Given that the AI is an active agent modifying the model, what prevents it from becoming a sophisticated vector for introducing subtle but critical errors?"

**Me:** Human is always responsible for the agent and applying changes

## **Geek out**

---

##### **Q:** "The reactive engine **Cyclone** is responsible for propagating changes. How does its internal dependency tracking algorithm perform garbage collection on abandoned dataflow paths or orphaned nodes in the prop tree?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "The job runner **Pinga** processes a queue of actions. What are the delivery guarantees of this job queue (e.g., at-least-once, exactly-once), and how does it handle poison pill jobs that consistently fail without halting the entire queue?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "**Veritech** is the execution engine for asset functions. What specific sandboxing technology (e.g., wasm, gVisor, Firecracker) does it use to securely execute user-defined TypeScript, and what is the cold-start performance overhead of this sandboxing?"

**SI:** Firecracker?

---

##### **Q:** "How is data consistency maintained between the Postgres database managed by the **Data Access Layer (DAL)** and the in-memory state of the **Cyclone** reactive graph during a high-concurrency event, like multiple users modifying the same model?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What is the mechanism for backpressure within the Cyclone engine? If a slow, downstream function (e.g., one making an external API call) cannot keep up with rapid upstream changes, how does the system prevent it from being overwhelmed?"

**SI:** ?

##### **Q:** "When defining a component, how does the system differentiate between a **prop** that is part of the intrinsic state of a resource versus one that is a transient, calculated value? How does this distinction affect storage and dependency tracking?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "The documentation mentions that asset functions can perform code generation. How does the system handle idempotency for these code-gen functions to ensure that running them multiple times with the same inputs produces a stable output without side effects?"

**SI:** ?

##### **Q:** "What is the precise protocol used between the **Veritech Client** and the **Veritech Server**? Is it gRPC or a custom RPC protocol, and how does it handle streaming logs for long-running function executions?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "The primary backend is **SDF**. How does it manage API versioning for its various internal clients (the web frontend, other backend services)? Does it use URL path versioning, custom headers, or some other strategy to handle breaking changes?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How does the **Secret-Aggregator** service work? Does it actively proxy secret retrieval requests to external vaults at execution time, or does it operate on a model of temporarily caching and injecting secrets into the execution context?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "Given the microservices-style architecture (SDF, Veritech, Pinga, etc.), how is distributed tracing implemented to allow an engineer to follow a single user action from the web UI through the entire backend stack to diagnose performance bottlenecks?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "The system's real-time collaboration implies a distributed state model. How does the architecture formally guarantee **causal consistency**? If User A's change must logically precede User B's, but the events arrive out of order due to network latency, how does the backend detect and resolve this causality violation without halting or requiring expensive global locks?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What is the formal strategy for **convergence**? If two users make conflicting changes to the same component, what specific **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**, or equivalent algorithms, are used to merge these changes deterministically? How does the system handle complex merges that aren't simple last-write-wins, such as merging changes to a list of security group rules?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "The reactive graph resembles a large-scale Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) system. What is the strategy for managing **glitches**—the transient, inconsistent states that can occur during a multi-step reactive propagation? How does the system ensure that a downstream function only executes after all of its upstream dependencies have fully settled into a consistent state?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How is **cyclical evaluation** handled at a fundamental level? If a user defines a model where Component A's output is derived from B's input, and B's output is derived from A's input, does the Cyclone engine detect this and fail gracefully, or does it have a concept of fixed-point iteration to find a stable equilibrium?"

**SI:** ?

##### **Q:** "An asset function in **Veritech** is an imperative black box that mutates external, non-transactional state (the cloud). If such a function fails midway through its execution, the external world is now in an inconsistent state. How does the model represent this 'tainted' or 'poisoned' state, and how does it prevent the reactive graph from propagating further calculations based on this indeterminate reality?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How does the platform model and manage the **impedance mismatch** between its own synchronous, reactive calculations and the highly asynchronous, eventually-consistent nature of cloud APIs? If a function triggers a cloud resource creation that takes 10 minutes to become fully available, how does the system avoid blocking calculations while still ensuring dependent functions don't execute prematurely?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What is the system's philosophy on **side-effects** within purely computational functions (i.e., those not explicitly marked for resource deployment)? Is it possible for a user to write a component with a function that, for example, makes a non-idempotent HTTP request during a seemingly read-only validation or qualification step? If so, how is this contained?"

**Me:** Yes it's possible, there is a built-in JS engine that runs in
Firecracker

**SI:** ?

##### **Q:** "Beyond distributed tracing of service calls, how does the platform provide observability into the **dataflow graph itself**? Is there an API to subscribe to a 'transaction log' for a specific AttributeValue, allowing an engineer to see the complete causal chain of user actions and function executions that led to its current state?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "What is the formal **identity and lifecycle model** for a resource? If a resource is destroyed and a new one is created with the same name and properties, how does the system differentiate them? Is identity based on a stable internal UUID, a composite key of user-defined properties, or the cloud provider's resource ID?"

**SI:** ?

##### **Q:** "Every change can trigger a cascade of function recalculations. How does the platform meter and govern the **computational cost** of user-defined components? What prevents a user from defining a component with a computationally expensive or inefficient function that inadvertently creates a massive, ongoing compute load on the backend, effectively allowing a 'denial-of-service' attack on the platform's resources?"

**SI:** ?

---

##### **Q:** "How does the architecture plan to handle deep, **platform-level schema migrations**? If the core structure of a prop or the serialization format of the entire model needs to change, what is the strategy for migrating petabytes of existing customer data and its historical snapshots without downtime, data loss, or invalidating all existing custom components?"

**SI:** ?
