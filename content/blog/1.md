I was asked by a friend to advise him a devops roadmap, all the ones that I
found on internet were incomplete or i just didnt like them, so after few months
of thinking about that topic, and todays nudge in chat from another soon-to-be
devops about roadmap. Ive took my favortite one size does not fit all pattern
and tryed to create respective maps for technologies and tools that would be
applicable on that stages.

So here we go, agile, focus on a speed of change, mostly about local development
experience

After code is written and somehow tested it's time to check if it works, and
also can it be merged, makes sense, and all the other fun staff of CI. Also here
is beggining of bureaucracy with task tracking, PR tracking, test tracking, code
review debates etc.

ship it to your runtime of choice.

After that serious business starts with all the *bility words and SLI SLA SLO
ROI.
