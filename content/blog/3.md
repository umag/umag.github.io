Recently I stumbled upon that talk https://youtu.be/3jJ1GhGkLY0 about
reinventing k8s by removing unneeded docker images, and that lead to intresting
consequience - They were able to create Modal an GPU serverless platform.

After that I went and read Eric's article about software 2.0
https://erikbern.com/2021/04/19/software-infrastructure-2.0-a-wishlist.html

And there was a great picture

It explained to me one of the issues with serverless adoption, current workflow
requires us to make lengthy deployments to cloud, and even having tools like
amplify or even cloud IDEs that still takes too long.

Another thing that I found is that there is no way to measure cost of a function
while you develop it. Yes you can approximate that via memory and cpu usage but
we dont do that during development. And that means that main feature of
serverless cost based development mostly not present during development phase -
and that means it does not bring value.

Of course there is vercel and next.js and they proving not just a platfrom for
FaaS development its a whole experience. I've struggled to just create lamda on
AWS and it also was not a simple task in GCP.

But when you can easyly instegrate your code with few annotations into runtime
that handles all the heavy lifting - that greatly helps. And we see that on a
vercel rise.
